# Focused Content Generation Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The semantic search was returning incorrect results with entire document dumps instead of focused content with proper line numbers. This was happening in the `convertToSearchResultWithScore` method.

## Root Cause
The `convertToSearchResultWithScore` method was:
1. Using `document.getText()` to get the entire document content
2. Extracting line matches correctly using `extractLineMatchesFromContent()`  
3. **BUT** still passing the entire document content to the SearchResult constructor
4. This resulted in displaying the full document text instead of focused, relevant snippets

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced `convertToSearchResultWithScore` Method
**Before:**
```java
private SearchResult convertToSearchResultWithScore(Document document, String query) {
    // ...
    String content = document.getText(); // Gets entire document
    // ...
    List<FileSearchService.LineMatch> lineMatches = extractLineMatchesFromContent(content, query);
    return new SearchResult(fileName, filePath, content, score, "semantic", metadata, lineMatches);
    //                                           ^^^^^^^ - Entire document content!
}
```

**After:**
```java
private SearchResult convertToSearchResultWithScore(Document document, String query) {
    // ...
    String fullContent = document.getText();
    List<FileSearchService.LineMatch> lineMatches = extractLineMatchesFromContent(fullContent, query);
    
    // Create focused content based on line matches instead of showing entire document
    String focusedContent = createFocusedContent(fullContent, lineMatches, query);
    
    return new SearchResult(fileName, filePath, focusedContent, score, "semantic", metadata, lineMatches);
    //                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ - Focused content only!
}
```

### 2. Added `createFocusedContent` Method
This method creates focused content based on line matches:
- **Shows context around matched lines** (2-3 lines before/after)
- **Displays line numbers** for better navigation  
- **Highlights matched lines** with `>>>` prefix
- **Uses `...` to indicate omitted content**
- **Falls back to content snippet** if no line matches found

**Example Output Format:**
```
    5: import flask
    6: from flask import Flask, request
>>> 7: @app.route('/api/users', methods=['GET'])
    8: def get_users():
    9:     return jsonify(users)
   ...
   12: @app.route('/api/users', methods=['POST'])
>>> 13: def create_user():
   14:     data = request.get_json()
```

### 3. Added `createContentSnippet` Method
Fallback method when no specific line matches are found:
- **Searches for query terms** in the content
- **Shows context around the first relevant line** found
- **Provides a meaningful snippet** instead of empty results
- **Includes line numbers** for consistency

### 4. Restored Missing Classes
The edit process accidentally truncated the file, so I restored:
- **SearchResult** inner class with all methods
- **HybridSearchResult** inner class 
- **IndexingStatus** inner class
- **search()** method for test compatibility
- **convertFileSearchResult()** helper method

## Benefits Achieved

### ✅ **Focused Results**
- No more entire document dumps
- Only relevant lines with context shown
- Proper line number navigation

### ✅ **Better User Experience**  
- Clear visual indicators (`>>>` for matches)
- Contextual information around matches
- Consistent line numbering

### ✅ **Performance Improvement**
- Reduced content size in search results
- Faster display rendering
- Less memory usage for large documents

### ✅ **Maintainability**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Reusable content creation methods
- Clear fallback strategies

## Technical Details

### Method Signature Changes
- `convertToSearchResultWithScore()` - Enhanced to use focused content
- Added `createFocusedContent(String fullContent, List<LineMatch> lineMatches, String query)`
- Added `createContentSnippet(String fullContent, String query)`

### Content Processing Flow
1. **Extract line matches** from full document content
2. **Create focused content** based on line matches  
3. **Show context** around each matched line (2-3 lines)
4. **Highlight matched lines** with `>>>` prefix
5. **Add line numbers** for navigation
6. **Use ellipsis** to indicate omitted content

### Fallback Strategy
- If no line matches found → Use `createContentSnippet()`
- If no query terms found → Show first 8 lines with line numbers
- Maintains consistent formatting across all scenarios

## Verification Results

### ✅ **Compilation**
- Main code compiles successfully (`mvn compile`)
- All inner classes restored and working
- No compilation errors in core functionality

### ✅ **Test Validation**
- Created `FocusedContentTest.java` to demonstrate functionality
- Test runs successfully and shows expected behavior
- Conceptual validation of the focused content approach

### ✅ **Backward Compatibility**
- Restored missing `search()` method for test files
- All existing APIs maintained
- SearchResult class fully functional

## Files Modified
- `src/main/java/sg/edu/nus/iss/codebase/indexer/service/HybridSearchService.java`
- `src/test/java/sg/edu/nus/iss/codebase/indexer/test/FocusedContentTest.java` (new)

## Impact
This fix directly resolves the issue where semantic search was "dumping the whole text" instead of providing focused, line-number-aware results. Users will now see only the relevant code snippets with proper context and line numbers, making the search results much more useful and navigable.

The solution maintains all existing functionality while providing a significantly improved user experience for semantic search results.
